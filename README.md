# Banking-ATM-System
A console-based Bank Management System in C++ featuring account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, and ATM simulation. Built with core OOP concepts encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism and uses file handling for persistent data storage.

 Project Overview
This is a console-based Bank Management System developed in C++. It simulates real-world banking operations by offering functionalities like:

- Account creation

- Deposits and withdrawals

- Balance inquiry

- ATM simulation

- Data storage using file handling

- Secure and structured design using OOP principles

ðŸ’Ž Functionalities
Feature	Description
- Account Creation	Allows users to create a new bank account by entering name, ID, and address
- Deposit	Enables users to deposit money into their account
- Withdrawal	Enables users to withdraw funds if the balance is sufficient
- Balance Inquiry	Shows current account balance based on ID
- ATM Simulation	Mimics basic ATM features for fast transactions
- Data Persistence	All data is saved and retrieved from files using file streams

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Concepts Used
âœ… C++ Programming
- Core syntax and structure of C++

- File input/output using <fstream>

âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This project demonstrates all four pillars of OOP:

-> Encapsulation

- Data members like name, address, and balance are kept private or protected.

- Access is controlled through public getter/setter methods.

 Example: setname(), getbalance()

-> Inheritance

- Base classes like Person and User are inherited by Account.

- Promotes code reuse and logical class hierarchy.

Example: class Account : public Person, public User

-> Abstraction

- The user interacts with high-level functions without worrying about internal implementations.

- Methods like createAccount(), withdraw(), or ATMmenu() abstract the core logic.

-> Polymorphism

- Function overriding is used where child classes redefine base class methods.

- If virtual functions are used, runtime polymorphism is demonstrated.

ðŸ’¾ File Handling
All account data is read from and written to files using:

- ifstream for reading

- ofstream or fstream for writing/updating

- Ensures data persistence between sessions.

- Functions like getline() and seekg()/seekp() help navigate file contents.
